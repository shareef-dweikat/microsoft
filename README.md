To run the project:
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

- Please note that React projects don't provide the full performance experience in the development environment. Some re-renderings may be triggered to make it easier to debug bugs, which can make the app a little slower.

- I did not address the styling, including mobile responsiveness. 

- I used the useState hook to manage the state. The requirements are simple, so I did not feel the need to include all the boilerplate that comes with state management tools.


- I designed the structure assuming the project will grow in the future. So i used the feature-based structure.
